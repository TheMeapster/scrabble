A text-based Scrabble board, by Jessica Su

Running the program:
MAC/LINUX: To run this program, type "python scrabble.py" at a terminal.
WINDOWS: This probably doesn't work on Windows.  Sorry.

Commands:
Arrow keys move around the screen.  hjklyubn works too, where h =
left, j = down, k = up, l = right, and yubn are the diagonal keys.

To place a letter on the board, move the cursor to the appropriate
space on the board and type the letter.  Once you're done with the
word, press Enter.  To delete a letter from the board, use Backspace, 
or to delete all letters, move the cursor to the "RECALL" button and 
press Enter.  YOU MUST TYPE IN UPPERCASE.

Space bar shuffles the tiles, as does moving the cursor to the
"SHUFFLE" button and pressing Enter.  In fact, all the buttons work
that way.  You can quit by pressing "q" anywhere but on the Scrabble
board, or by moving the cursor to the "QUIT" button and pressing
Enter.

Options:
To play with challenges enabled, type "python scrabble.py -c".

To play with the international dictionary, type "python scrabble.py -i".

Other:
Scrabble is the property of Hasbro, not me.  The dictionaries are not
my property either.
